## 🚨 Troubleshooting During Recording

### If Pipeline is Slow

- **Say:** "While the pipeline executes, let me explain what's happening in each stage"
- Use the time to explain the technical architecture
- Show other parts of the system (monitoring, documentation)

### If Something Fails

- **Stay calm and explain:** "This demonstrates our failure handling - the pipeline stops on errors"
- Show the error logs if visible
- **Say:** "In production, we'd investigate the logs and fix the issue before proceeding"

### If Approval Takes Time

- Use the waiting time to show monitoring dashboard
- Explain the governance process
- Show security scan results in detail
