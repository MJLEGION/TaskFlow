# 🚀 TaskFlow Deployment Guide

## Overview

This guide covers the complete deployment process for TaskFlow, including staging and production environments with full CD pipeline automation.

## 🏗️ Deployment Architecture

```
GitHub Repository
├── develop branch → Staging Environment
├── main branch → Production Environment (Manual Approval)
└── feature/* → No deployment (PR only)
```

## 🔄 Automated Deployment Process

### 1. Staging Deployment (develop branch)

- **Trigger**: Push to `develop` branch
- **Approval**: Automatic
- **URL**: https://taskflow-staging.herokuapp.com
- **Purpose**: Pre-production testing and validation

### 2. Production Deployment (main branch)

- **Trigger**: Push to `main` branch
- **Approval**: Manual approval required
- **URL**: https://taskflow-prod.herokuapp.com
- **Purpose**: Live production environment

## 📋 Pre-Deployment Checklist

### Before Staging Deployment

- [ ] All tests pass locally
- [ ] Code follows conventional commit standards
- [ ] Security scans pass
- [ ] Feature branch merged to develop

### Before Production Deployment

- [ ] Staging deployment successful
- [ ] Staging environment tested
- [ ] Security scans pass
- [ ] Manual approval obtained
- [ ] Monitoring alerts configured

## 🔒 Security Requirements

### Dependency Scanning

- **Tool**: npm audit
- **Threshold**: No high or critical vulnerabilities
- **Action**: Pipeline fails if vulnerabilities found

### Container Scanning

- **Tool**: Trivy
- **Scope**: Container images and filesystem
- **Output**: SARIF format uploaded to GitHub Security

## 📊 Monitoring Setup

### Health Checks

- **Endpoint**: `/health`
- **Frequency**: Every 30 seconds
- **Timeout**: 3 seconds
- **Retries**: 3 attempts

### Metrics Collection

- **Endpoint**: `/metrics`
- **Format**: Prometheus format
- **Scrape Interval**: 15 seconds

### Alerting Thresholds

- CPU Usage > 80% for 5 minutes
- Memory Usage > 85% for 5 minutes
- Response Time > 2 seconds for 2 minutes
- Error Rate > 5% for 2 minutes

## 🚨 Rollback Procedures

### Automatic Rollback Triggers

- Health check failures
- Critical alert thresholds exceeded
- Deployment timeout (10 minutes)

### Manual Rollback

```bash
# Rollback to previous version
kubectl rollout undo deployment/taskflow-production

# Or using Docker Compose
docker-compose -f docker-compose.production.yml down
docker-compose -f docker-compose.production.yml up -d --scale taskflow=0
# Deploy previous image
```

## 🔧 Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

#### Deployment Fails

1. Check security scan results
2. Verify all tests pass
3. Check resource availability
4. Review deployment logs

#### Health Check Fails

1. Check application logs
2. Verify database connectivity
3. Check external service dependencies
4. Validate configuration

#### High Resource Usage

1. Check for memory leaks
2. Review database query performance
3. Analyze traffic patterns
4. Scale resources if needed

## 📈 Performance Monitoring

### Key Metrics

- **Response Time**: < 500ms average
- **Throughput**: > 100 requests/second
- **Error Rate**: < 1%
- **Uptime**: > 99.9%
