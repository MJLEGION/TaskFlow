```

## 4. Create Phase 1 Task Issues

Create detailed task issues for Phase 1 work:

### Task Issues:

1. **Set up CI Pipeline**

   - Configure GitHub Actions
   - Add linting and testing
   - Set up status checks

2. **Add Unit Tests**

   - Backend API tests
   - Frontend component tests
   - Test coverage reporting

3. **Implement Code Linting**

   - ESLint configuration
   - Code style enforcement
   - Pre-commit hooks

4. **Configure Branch Protection**

   - Require PR reviews
   - Require status checks
   - Restrict direct pushes

5. **Update Documentation**
   - README improvements
   - Setup instructions
   - Contributing guidelines

## 5. Link Issues to Project Board

1. Add all milestone issues to the "Backlog" column
2. Add Phase 1 task issues to "To Do" column
3. Move tasks to "In Progress" as you work on them
4. Move to "Review" when creating PRs
5. Move to "Done" when completed

## 6. Project Board URL

After creating the project board, add the URL to your README.md:

```markdown
## Project Management

- **Project Board**: [TaskFlow Development Board](https://github.com/MJLEGION/TaskFlow/projects/1)
- **Issues**: [GitHub Issues](https://github.com/MJLEGION/TaskFlow/issues)
```

## 7. Best Practices

- Link PRs to issues using keywords (e.g., "Closes #1")
- Update issue status regularly
- Add detailed comments on progress
- Use labels for categorization
- Set milestones for time-based tracking
- Review and update the board weekly

This setup will demonstrate professional project management practices and meet the Phase 1 requirements for detailed project planning and tracking.
